**Best scored experiment:** `M19_C_FULL_CHAIN_PENDING` at **0.8800**.
**M19-C full_chain:** scored (score 0.8800).

## Recommendation

M19-C **improved** to 0.8800 (> 0.877). Gap recovery + smoothing add value on top of divisions.

- **Tune the `full_chain` gates** (risk: medium):
  - safe divisions: slightly widen sister/parent-child gates to admit more true divisions;
  - gap1/gap2: sweep the distance and velocity gates to add more metric-valid synthetic chains;
  - keep an eye on `synthetic_nodes_added` vs score to stay ahead of the node penalty.
- Next variant: a tuned full_chain (e.g. `M20_A_FULLCHAIN_TUNED`).

## Recorded decisions (history)

- **after `M18_C_EDGE_PRUNE`** (2026-07-02, risk low):
  - observation: det-threshold (0.99/0.985/0.995/0.975) and a small post-ILP edge prune all score 0.874. The predict command is a flat lever; the ILP re-optimizes to the same graph.
  - recommendation: Stop tuning the predict command. Move to post-GEFF metric-aware processing targeting the node over-prediction penalty and the 0.1-weighted division term.  → next: `M19_A_SAFE_DIVISIONS_PRUNE`
- **after `M19_A_SAFE_DIVISIONS_PRUNE`** (2026-07-05, risk medium):
  - observation: Safe divisions + isolated prune moved 0.874 -> 0.877 with zero synthetic nodes. Metric-aware post-processing is the correct path.
  - recommendation: Spend the next submission on M19-C full_chain (adds gap recovery + smoothing on the same division core). Gate on valid=True and fallback_used=False before submitting.  → next: `M19_C_FULL_CHAIN_PENDING`
- **after `M19_C_FULL_CHAIN_PENDING`** (2026-07-08, risk medium):
  - observation: M19-C full_chain scored 0.880 (> M19-A 0.877). Gap recovery + line-fit smoothing add value on top of divisions, and 1309 synthetic nodes did not trip the node over-prediction penalty. full_chain is the new best.
  - recommendation: Tune the full_chain gates: slightly widen the safe-division sister/parent-child gates, and sweep the gap1/gap2 distance + velocity gates to admit more metric-valid synthetic chains while watching synthetic_nodes_added vs score to stay ahead of the node penalty.  → next: `M20_A_FULLCHAIN_TUNED`
- **after `M20_A_FULLCHAIN_TUNED`** (2026-07-08, risk medium):
  - observation: M20's pre-postprocess base learned graph changed vs M19-C (n_nodes_before 131797->142193, n_edges_before 118992->127563) despite an identical predict command - a different support-pack/weights artifact was selected on Kaggle. The gate-tuning result is not trustworthy or submittable.
  - recommendation: Use M20_A_FULLCHAIN_TUNED_FIXED, which reproduces M19-C's exact artifact/weights selection, logs the selected artifact/repo/weights/support-pack, and adds a hard baseline guard (tolerance 0) that recommends DO_NOT_SUBMIT_BASELINE_MISMATCH if the base differs. Attach ONLY the canonical 50ep-v1 support pack.  → next: `M20_A_FULLCHAIN_TUNED_FIXED`
